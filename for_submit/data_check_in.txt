# COVID-19-20 Challenge

## Data

**Training and Validation:** Unenhanced chest CTs from 200 and 50 patients, 
respectively, with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and ground truth 
annotations of COVID-19 lesions in the lung.

**Testing:** Additional, unseen 46 patients with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 
and ground truth annotations of COVID-19 lesions in the lung CT. The test 
cases are from a variety of sources, included sources not used for training 
and validation.
